        <h1>4. Experiments / Results</h1>
        <p>We recorded runs in real-time with overlaid inference results, for analysis.</p>
        <p>Our best runs achieved worst-case 15m range 96% accuracy, and best-case at less than 5m 98% in available, real-life testing environments at 45+ FPS on mid-level NVIDIA Jetson Xavier hardware (MSRP $479 to $579) using an Intel RealSense d435i (MSRP $334), when trained on a combination of data from both generally available and privately sourced datasets.</p>
        <p>As expected, YOLO versions (v5 and above) outperformed Faster R-CNN in speed by a factor greater than two (2) on each run; in our scenario, YOLO maintained accuracy with respect to Faster R-CNN within 7% over short, medium, and long-range inference distance at same average forklift speed and near identical surrounding conditions.</p>
